## How It Works

### 1. Content Script
- Injects a floating toggle button and sidebar container into every LeetCode problem page.
- Extracts problem data (title, description, difficulty, tags) using robust DOM selectors.
- Listens for URL changes to update context on single-page navigation.

### 2. Sidebar (React App)
- Renders inside an iframe for isolation and security.
- Loads the current problem‚Äôs context and displays it at the top.
- Provides a chat interface for interacting with the AI assistant.
- Handles quick actions and displays conversation history.

### 3. Popup (API Key Management)
- Accessible from the Chrome toolbar.
- Lets users securely enter and save their Groq API key.
- Shows basic stats and settings.

### 4. Background Script
- Acts as a bridge for messaging between the popup, content script, and sidebar.
- Handles all API requests to Groq, ensuring the API key is never exposed to the page context.

### 5. Build & Security
- Uses Vite for fast, modern bundling.
- All scripts (including React) are bundled‚Äîno external scripts, fully CSP compliant.
- Post-build scripts ensure the correct script tags are injected and all resources are in place.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  
  All scripts are bundled locally; no CDN dependencies. This avoids CSP violations and ensures the extension works out-of-the-box.
- **SPA Navigation on LeetCode:**  
  Uses a MutationObserver to detect URL changes and update the sidebar context without requiring a page reload.
- **API Key Security:**  
  The API key is stored in Chrome‚Äôs extension storage and never exposed to the page or network requests outside the extension context.
- **Build Process:**  
  Vite is configured to output all necessary bundles, and a post-build script injects the correct script tags into the final HTML.

## Example Use Cases

- **Stuck on a problem?**  
  Open the sidebar and ask for a hint or explanation.
- **Want to understand time complexity?**  
  Use the quick action or type your question for an instant breakdown.
- **Need to debug your approach?**  
  Paste your logic or ask the AI for common pitfalls on the current problem.
